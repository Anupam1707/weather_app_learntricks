# Internship Project - Learntricks Edutech

This repository contains the project file for the weather application developed during my internship at Learntricks Edutech. This project showcases the skills and techniques learned and applied during the internship.

## Project Included:
**Weather App**: A Python-based application that fetches and displays weather information for different locations. It utilizes APIs for real-time weather data and includes features such as temperature, humidity, and forecast details.

## Key Technologies Used:
